Manual Qt library is required to build the system. To compile the source code, please 
make sure Qt 4 is correctly installed and configurated. The source code is tested ONLY 
in 64 bit Linux system.

Compile Procedures: 
1. tar xvf package.tar.gz 
2. cd package / 
3. qmake (or qmake - qt4) 
4. make 

Usage: 
The program provides a GUI for convenience. 
************************************** NOTICE *********************************** 
A consistent set of description file and image sequence, together with camera 
parameters file and contour file, is needed for the program to execute correctly. 

A typical setting is as follows:
./alien.des
./data/alien/0000.jpg
./data/alien/0001.jpg
...
./data/alien/0023.jpg
./data/alien/camera.txt
./data/alien/contour.txt
********************************************************************************* 

The description file for the above setting is included in the submission. 
1. To reconstruct a model, first select the reconstructor and specify all the 
parameters needed for that reconstructor, then load the description file (.des 
file) of the model from the "File" menu. 

2. To view a reconstructed model, simply load the model file (.vxl file) from the 
"File" menu. Several reconstructed models are provided in the model folder, 
which can be loaded into the system directly. 

3. Mouse interaction is allowed in the model viewing region. Simply drag the model 
to change view point. Use the wheel to zoom in / out. 

4. To view the grids used for reconstructor, press key w; to view the model view
 a naive lighting, press space bar. 

5. It is critical to choose a correct background threshold in order for voxel 
coloring algorithm to work properly. Typically, the value for dark object with a 
bright background can be set lower, e. g. 100 - 150; in case the model contains 
bright region, it is highly recommended that the background threshold set above 
200. Usually a few try - and - error are needed to obtain satisfactory results.
